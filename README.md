# Flying with the Sky Dragon

[View the project on carvacodes.github.io](https://carvacodes.github.io/?project=flying-with-the-sky-dragon).

An homage to one of my favorite games, Cave Story. Animations are purely CSS, while the initial generation of the clouds is handled in JS. Click/tap the screen to change the scene (an effect largely driven by transitions, filters, and a single gradient).

Also, if you haven't played [Cave Story](https://www.cavestory.org/download/cave-story.php), please go do that!
