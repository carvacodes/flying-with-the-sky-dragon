# Flying with the Sky Dragon

An homage to one of my (and many folks') favorite games, Cave Story. Animations are purely CSS, while the initial generation of the clouds is handled in JS. Click/tap the screen to change the scene (an effect largely driven by transitions, filters, and a single gradient).\nAlso, if you haven't played Cave Story, please go do that!
